# GameTime  1 
A simple first look at video game logic:

This was my first attempt to apply what I was learning to my impression of video game logic,  
and ultimately the goal was to teach myself randomization as it had not been covered in class.
I tried to structure it such that I could build on it as I learned but ultimately the logic was 
not sustainable for more complex concepts.
