# Game-Time-1st-Experiment
A simple first look at video game logic
This was my first attempt to apply what I was learning in class to my impression of video game logic.  
Ultimately the goal was to teach myself randomization as it had not been covered in class.
I tried to structure it such that I could build on it as I learned but ultimately the logic was 
not sustainable for more complex concepts.  It was easier to start over.
